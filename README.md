This code is a rough demo for discussion and debugging only. Relevant derivations can be found in 2DGS_code_supp.pdf, which is only available in Chinese. The code includes a built-in demo. 
Ideally, in any environment configured with 3dgs, first run \\
```pip install submodules/two-d-diff-gaussian-rasterization```\\
then execute \\
```python --conf_path ./config/base.yaml```\\
After that, you can find 0_rgb.jpg and 0_depth.jpg in the current directory.
